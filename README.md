# Snakegame

This project presents a modern twist to the classic Snake Game by introducing hand gesture control using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV for graphical display, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and the pygame or playsound library for playing sound effects. Instead of keyboard input, players use hand gestures to control the snake's direction.
